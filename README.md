Laboratory Exercise 2: MySQL Functions, Group By, Order By and Constraints
The activity focused on using MySQL functions, as well as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and constraints.
Although these concepts were new to me, I was able to complete the tasks with the help of the provided functions.
It was an enjoyable activity that greatly enhanced students’ skills in creating, managing, and displaying database content.
